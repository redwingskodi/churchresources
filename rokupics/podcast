        <itunes:summary>The Portage church of Christ is a group of pre-denominational Christians that are striving to serve the Lord together. Our goal is to please God, and we believe that the best way to do that is to follow the pattern that was established by the churches in the first century and revealed in the New Testament.  We have no creed or doctrine except the Bible and we follow the Bible only. We strive for unity in the teaching of New Testament doctrine.  Our congregation is not part of, or subject to, any larger man-made religious organization. We are a completely autonomous congregation. We are locally governed, just as the church in the first century was.</itunes:summary>
